Diaspora Identity
=================

This project serves as a proposal to define identity for Diaspora.
When completed, this should replace the branding section of the wiki, deprecating the hand-written versions,
and the Helvetica version. 
Existing artwork should of course be kept for historical reasons and recognition to their authors.

## Contributing

This is an open source project, it uses open formats and licenses, so please treat it as such.

If you find any issues, then file an issue, if you can help out with an issue, then fork it and send a pull request. Please don't add propietary format files as PSDs or AIs into your PR. 

Translations are welcomed, but keep in mind that new versions of the documents here will require to adapt the translation (or even starting over...).

Most of the artwork here is created using Inkscape, so it will be the better choice to read some files.

## Choices made

Everything is a proposal, but some choices had been made by observation and having feedback from the community. 

### Font

Titillium font was my proposal, since I think it's quite unique an different from every other sans serif font, and it's under an OFL license, but I considered another options. 

Mainly, it's biggest competitor was **Montserrat** (http://www.fontspace.com/julieta-ulanovsky/montserrat), a font which is very close to the commercial Proxima Nova, but under a SIL font license. Montserrat is a beautiful round sans-serif font, which I think may be better for the Diaspora* UI, not for communicating.

### Colors and other stuff

Some identity pieces are still to be discovered, as the colors, copywriting style (voice), and some identity elements
as the dandelion imagery, which has been largely used and it's widely accepted by the community as a part of Diaspora*'s identity. Feedback is welcome.

This is a work in progress and most of it is guidelines, which means you can use it or not, but sticking to some 
guidelines will give Diaspora* a wider sense of branding, which will be helpful in general for every aspect of the project.

## Branding vs. fan art

Identity guidelines are not meant to destroy creativity. They exist to bring consistency to a particular brand or project.

For that reason, these guidelines do not harm (or even reach) fan art, which should be always thankfully welcomed.
